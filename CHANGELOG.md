## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-25

Bug-sweep release. 11 reported issues fixed plus two stability wins discovered during code-level triage of the Basecamp queue.

### Added

- **Give-kudos block + shortcode** — new `wb-gamification/give-kudos` block and `[wb_gam_give_kudos]` shortcode let any logged-in member send kudos from any frontend page. Recipient resolved server-side from username or email.
- **Per-action cooldown + daily-cap admin override** — Settings → Points table now exposes editable cooldown (seconds) and daily-cap inputs per action with autosave to `POST /actions/{id}/overrides`. Resettable via `DELETE`.
- **ActionSchedulerCleaner** — daily cron prunes pending, failed, and complete `actionscheduler_actions` rows older than 7 days. Retention is filterable via `wb_gam_as_retention_days`. Prevents the long-running AS bloat that was causing slow page loads on busy installs.

### Changed

- Settings dashboard container now uses 1600px max-width on wide monitors; consolidated a duplicate `.wbgam-wrap` rule that was overriding the limit.
- Challenges and Community Challenges admin pages unified under a single Challenges menu entry with Individual / Community tabs. Old `?page=wb-gam-community-challenges` URLs still route correctly.
- Async flag dropped on five low-volume BuddyPress + WPMediaVerse actions (activity update, activity comment, friend accept, media reaction, media comment received, photo favorite received) so points update synchronously without Action Scheduler delay.
- Admin notices now render above the WB Gamification chrome instead of being visually trapped inside `.wbgam-wrap` (DOM-level lift in `assets/js/admin-rest-form.js`).
- Configure Points and Top Actions dashboard CTAs route to the in-page Points tab via hash anchor (`#points`) instead of the broken `?tab=points` query string.

### Fixed

- **LeaderboardNudge AS queue runaway** — `dispatch_batch()` now calls `as_has_scheduled_action()` before enqueueing per-user nudges, so repeated cron runs no longer compound into thousands of duplicate pending jobs.
- **Challenge timezone drift** — `ChallengeEngine` start / end queries use `UTC_TIMESTAMP()` instead of MySQL `NOW()`, matching the UTC-stored values written by the admin form. Challenges now activate at the correct moment on servers with a non-UTC MySQL session timezone.
- **datetime-local UTC hydration** — admin Challenge + Community Challenge edit inputs now convert UTC values to the browser's local time on page load (`data-wb-gam-utc` + `hydrateUtcDateTimeInputs`), so the saved time stops drifting by the timezone offset on every edit.
- **Empty toast text** — `NotificationBridge::on_level_changed` and `on_streak_milestone` now backfill a translated `message` string so the toast bubble is no longer empty.
- **Duplicate challenge completion side effects** — `ChallengeEngine::complete_challenge()` no longer calls `do_action('wb_gam_challenge_completed')` twice; BP activity rows, webhook deliveries, and emails now fire once per completion.
- **Kudos recipient lookup** — `KudosController::create_item` accepts a `recipient_login` field and resolves usernames or emails to user IDs server-side, so the new give-kudos block doesn't depend on the public `/wp/v2/users` endpoint (which only returns post authors).
- **BP activity filter labels** — `ActivityIntegration::register_activity_types` now exposes four distinct filter entries (Badge earned, Level up, Kudos sent, Challenge complete) instead of collapsing into one Gamification row. Sites can override via the new `wb_gam_activity_context_label` filter.

### Dev

- New filter `wb_gam_as_retention_days` (default `7`) to tune Action Scheduler retention per site.
- New filter `wb_gam_activity_context_label` exposes BP activity context labels for per-type customisation.
- New REST routes: `POST /actions/{id}/overrides`, `DELETE /actions/{id}/overrides` (admin-only).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-18

Jetonomy 1.4.3 + Pro event triggers and an in-tree WPMediaVerse Free + Pro manifest stack.

### Added

- **Jetonomy 1.4.3 integration** — reputation and leaderboard wiring via the manifest layer.
- **Jetonomy Pro event triggers** — polls, direct messages, badges, and reactions emit gamification events.
- **WPMediaVerse Free + Pro manifests** — owned in-tree so the host site no longer ships the manifest layer.
- **`wb_gam_award_skipped` hook** — fires from every silent-skip path in the engine so integrations can react to skipped awards.

### Fixed

- Points history view renders the manifest label instead of the raw `action_id`.
- WPMediaVerse handlers use upstream hook arguments instead of a broken static lookup.
- Boot path shows an admin notice instead of a fatal error when `vendor/` is missing (#49).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-10

Distribution pipeline and admin polish ahead of the integration release.

### Added

- EDD SDK integration for automatic plugin updates from wbcomdesigns.com.

### Changed

- Consolidated admin stylesheets into a single `assets/css/admin.css`.
- Populated admin dashboard with KPI cards, top actions, top earners, and a daily sparkline.
- `submit-achievement` view.js is translation-ready.

- **Public profile pages** at `/u/{user_login}` with privacy gate, OG meta, Schema.org JSON-LD.
- **Year-in-review recap** with shareable summary (top action, top badges, longest streak).
- **Redemption store** — custom / WooCommerce-backed rewards with point cost, stock, active/inactive state.
- **Outbound webhooks** for Zapier / Make / n8n integrations.
- **Weekly recap email engine** with member-personalised digests + admin test-send.

- **OpenBadges 3.0 credential issuance** at `/credentials/{badge}/{user}`.
- **Public OG share URL** for badges (`/?wb-gam-share=<badge_slug>`).

### Added — Frontend

- **Welcome notice** on plugin admin pages until setup wizard is completed.
- **3rd-party-notice suppression** via body-class-scoped CSS (keeps plugin own + critical core).

### Added — Platform

- **REST API** with 65 endpoints across 24 controllers; standardised envelope (`items_key`, `total`, `pages`, `has_more`); all responses ISO 8601 UTC; per-resource filter hooks.
- **OpenAPI 3.0 spec** auto-generated at `/wp-json/wb-gamification/v1/openapi.json`.

- **Journey corpus** — 15 deterministic journey files at `audit/journeys/` covering customer / admin / qa / security / release flows.
- **Pre-release agent smoke** — generic Claude-level `wp-plugin-smoke` skill consumes per-plugin `docs/qa/qa.config.json` to dispatch Sonnet for the full smoke walk.
- **Build-release gate** — `bin/build-release.sh` refuses to package without a green smoke report at `docs/qa/.last-smoke-pass.json`.
